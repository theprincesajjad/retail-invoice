# Redesign Existing Projects

This skill is a **diagnostic**. It finds what is wrong with an existing interface and fixes it in place.

## Design values

All concrete values (fonts, background colors, spacing, radius, icon sets, motion timing) live in the **Design Values** section at the bottom of this file. That section is the single source of truth. The audit below tells you *what to look for*; Design Values tells you *what to replace it with*.

Never invent a font, hex value, spacing number, radius, or easing curve that is not in Design Values. If a situation is not covered there, ask rather than guessing.

To adapt this skill to a different design system, edit only the Design Values section. The entire audit follows it automatically.

## How this works

1. **Scan** — Read the codebase. Identify the framework, styling method (Tailwind, vanilla CSS, styled-components, CSS modules), and the current design patterns.
2. **Diagnose** — Run the full audit below. List every generic pattern, weak point, and missing state you find. Report before fixing.
3. **Fix** — Apply targeted upgrades inside the existing stack, in the Fix Priority order. Do not rewrite from scratch. Improve what is there.

# Design audit

## Typography

- **Browser default fonts, or Inter / Roboto / Arial / Open Sans / Helvetica.** Replace with an approved font from the Design Values section.
- **Two typefaces on one site.** Consolidate to one, unless the project brief explicitly calls for a pair.
- **Italic type anywhere.** Remove it. Use weight, size, or color for emphasis instead.
- **Ultra bold weights (800, 900, black).** Cap at semibold or bold.
- **Only Regular (400) and Bold (700) in use.** Introduce Medium (500) and SemiBold (600) for finer hierarchy.
- **Headlines lack presence.** Increase display size and tighten letter spacing so headlines feel heavy and intentional. Adjust tracking only within the line height the type scale already provides.
- **Body text too wide.** Cap paragraph measure at roughly 65 characters.
- **Numbers in a proportional font.** Enable `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for data heavy interfaces.
- **Missing letter spacing adjustments.** Negative tracking on large headers, positive tracking on small labels and caps.
- **All caps subheaders everywhere.** Switch to sentence case or small caps. Do not switch to italics.
- **Orphaned words.** A single word alone on the last line. Fix with `text-wrap: balance` on headings and `text-wrap: pretty` on body.
- **Hyphens inside copy.** Do not use `-` in headings, body text, or labels. Rewrite the phrase.
- **Arbitrary or off scale font sizes.** Resolve every size to the Tailwind type scale. Never leave `text-[19px]`, `font-size: 22px`, or `1.4rem` in place. If a size does not land on a step, snap to the closest step below and take its paired line height. Do not combine this with independently set custom line heights from the two fixes above; adjust only within the matched step's value so the rules do not fight.
- **Buttons with off scale type.** Main buttons `text-base` semibold. Header buttons `text-sm` semibold.

## Color and surfaces

- **Background colors outside the approved palette.** Snap every dark surface to the approved dark values. Do not substitute `#0a0a0a`, `#121212`, or a tinted navy.
- **Gradient backgrounds of any kind.** Backgrounds are flat. Remove linear, radial, and mesh background gradients entirely. The only permitted gradient is on hero heading text.
- **Hero heading with flat text color.** Apply the approved left to right text gradient for the active theme.
- **The purple and blue "AI gradient" aesthetic.** The single most common AI fingerprint. Replace with a flat neutral base and one considered accent.
- **Oversaturated accent colors.** Keep saturation under 80% so accents sit with the neutrals instead of screaming.
- **More than one accent color.** Pick one. Remove the rest.
- **Mixing warm and cool grays.** Commit to one gray family and tint consistently.
- **Generic `box-shadow`.** Tint shadows toward the background hue instead of pure black at low opacity.
- **Flat surfaces with zero texture.** Add subtle noise or grain overlays. Do not reach for a gradient to solve flatness.
- **Inconsistent lighting direction.** Audit every shadow so they imply one light source.
- **A random dark section inside a light page, or the reverse.** This reads as a copy paste accident. Commit to one background tone, or step to a neighboring approved shade rather than jumping to `#111` in the middle of a cream page.
- **Empty sections with no depth.** Add high quality background imagery, masked or overlaid at low opacity, or a subtle pattern. Use `https://picsum.photos/seed/{name}/1920/1080` when real assets are unavailable. Never solve this with an ambient gradient.

## Layout

- **Everything centered and symmetrical.** Break symmetry with offset margins, mixed aspect ratios, or a left aligned header over centered content.
- **Three equal card columns as the feature row.** The most generic AI layout. Three to five benefits is correct as *content*; the *layout* should be a two column zig zag, an asymmetric grid, horizontal scroll, or masonry.
- **`height: 100vh` on full screen sections.** Replace with `min-height: 100dvh` to stop layout jump on iOS Safari.
- **Complex flexbox percentage math.** Replace with CSS Grid.
- **No max width container.** Add a constraint around 1200 to 1440px with auto margins. Hero heading and subheading cap at 680px.
- **Cards forced to equal height by flexbox.** Allow variable heights, or use masonry when content length varies.
- **Radius chosen by feel.** Every radius comes from Tailwind's scale. When a shape sits inside another and the gap is under 32px, the inner radius equals the outer radius minus the gap, applied only when the result exceeds 2.
- **Spacing values invented ad hoc.** Every margin, padding, and gap resolves to the approved spacing scale.
- **No overlap or depth.** Elements sitting flat beside each other. Use negative margins to layer.
- **Symmetrical vertical padding.** Adjust optically. Bottom padding usually needs slightly more.
- **Dashboard always has a left sidebar.** Try top navigation, a floating command menu, or a collapsible panel.
- **Missing whitespace.** Step up one level on the spacing scale and let it breathe. Dense layouts suit data dashboards, not marketing pages.
- **Buttons not bottom aligned in card groups.** Pin CTAs to the bottom of each card so they form one clean horizontal line.
- **Feature lists starting at different vertical positions.** In pricing and comparison columns, lists must start at the same Y position. Use fixed height title and price blocks.
- **Inconsistent vertical rhythm across side by side elements.** Align titles, descriptions, prices, and buttons across all items. Misaligned baselines read as broken.
- **Mathematical alignment that looks optically wrong.** Icons beside text, play buttons in circles, and text in buttons often need one or two pixels of optical correction.

## Interactivity and states

- **Default or instant transitions.** Every transition uses a custom cubic bezier with real weight, not `ease` or `linear`. Baseline: `transition-all duration-700 ease-[cubic-bezier(0.32,0.72,0,1)]`. Micro interactions such as color shifts may run shorter, but never below 200ms and never on a default curve.
- **Elements appearing statically on scroll.** Content entering the viewport fades up heavily: `translate-y-16 blur-md opacity-0` resolving to `translate-y-0 blur-0 opacity-100` over 800ms or longer.
- **`window.addEventListener('scroll')` for reveals.** Replace with `IntersectionObserver` or Framer Motion `whileInView`. Scroll listeners cause continuous reflow and destroy mobile performance.
- **Standard docked navbar.** Replace with the floating island pattern: a detached glass pill, `mt-6 mx-auto w-max rounded-full`.
- **Hamburger icon that swaps or disappears.** The lines must rotate and translate into a true X using `rotate-45` and `-rotate-45` with absolute positioning.
- **Mobile menu as a dropdown.** Open a screen filling overlay with `backdrop-blur-3xl` over `bg-black/80` or `bg-white/80`, with links staggered in from `translate-y-12 opacity-0` using incremental delays.
- **No hover states on buttons.** Add a background shift, slight scale, or translate.
- **No active or pressed feedback.** Add `scale(0.98)` or `translateY(1px)` on press.
- **Missing focus ring.** Visible focus indicators are an accessibility requirement, not a style choice.
- **No loading states.** Replace circular spinners with skeleton loaders shaped like the real layout.
- **No empty states.** Design a composed "getting started" view instead of a blank panel.
- **No error states.** Inline, specific form errors. Never `window.alert()`.
- **Dead links.** Buttons pointing at `#`. Link them or visually disable them.
- **No current page indicator in navigation.** Style the active link distinctly.
- **Scroll jumping.** Add `scroll-behavior: smooth` for anchor navigation.
- **Animating `top`, `left`, `width`, or `height`.** Switch to `transform` and `opacity` for GPU acceleration.

## Content

- **Generic names like "John Doe".** Use diverse, realistic names.
- **Fake round numbers like `99.99%`, `50%`, `$100.00`.** Use organic data: `47.2%`, `$99.00`, `+1 (312) 847-1928`.
- **Placeholder companies like "Acme Corp", "Nexus", "SmartFlow".** Invent contextual, believable brand names.
- **AI copywriting cliches.** Never "Elevate", "Seamless", "Unleash", "Next Gen", "Game changer", "Delve", "Tapestry", or "In the world of". Write plain, specific language.
- **Vague value propositions.** "Streamline" and "optimize" say nothing. Replace with a measurable outcome: "Cut weekly reporting from 4 hours to 15 minutes".
- **Features listed with no outcome.** Every feature line should state what it means for the user.
- **Weak CTAs.** Never "Learn more" or "Submit". Use a verb plus what they get: "Start free trial", "Book a demo".
- **Competing CTAs above the fold.** One primary action per page.
- **Proof buried at the bottom.** Move testimonials, logos, and numbers next to the claims they support.
- **No risk reversal.** Add at least one of free trial, free plan, no credit card, cancel anytime, money back guarantee.
- **Exclamation marks in success messages.** Remove them. Be confident, not loud.
- **"Oops!" error messages.** Be direct: "Connection failed. Please try again."
- **Passive voice.** "We could not save your changes", not "Mistakes were made".
- **Identical blog post dates.** Randomize them.
- **The same avatar for multiple users.** Unique asset per person.
- **Lorem Ipsum.** Never. Write real draft copy.
- **Title Case On Every Header.** Sentence case instead.

## Component patterns

- **Generic card look: border plus shadow plus white background.** Drop to background color alone, or spacing alone. Cards should exist only where elevation communicates hierarchy.
- **Border on a single side of a card.** Never. Borders go all the way around or not at all.
- **Always one filled button plus one ghost button.** Introduce text links or tertiary styles to cut visual noise.
- **Pill shaped "New" and "Beta" badges.** Try square badges, flags, or plain text labels.
- **Accordion FAQ.** The FAQ section itself should stay, six to twelve questions. Change the pattern: a side by side list, searchable help, or inline progressive disclosure reads better than a stack of chevrons.
- **Three card carousel testimonials with dots.** Replace with a masonry wall, embedded social posts, or one rotating quote.
- **Pricing table with three towers.** Emphasize the recommended tier with color and weight, not extra height.
- **Modals for everything.** Use inline editing, slide over panels, or expandable sections for simple actions.
- **Avatar circles exclusively.** Try squircles or rounded squares.
- **Light and dark toggle as a sun and moon switch.** Use a dropdown, system preference detection, or a settings entry.
- **Four column footer link farm.** Simplify to main paths plus legally required links.

## Iconography and imagery

- **Lucide, Feather, Material Icons, or Material Symbols.** These are the default AI choices. Replace with an approved set from the Design Values section.
- **Rocketship for "Launch", shield for "Security".** Replace cliche metaphors with bolt, fingerprint, spark, vault.
- **Inconsistent stroke widths.** Standardize every icon to one stroke weight.
- **Missing favicon.** Always ship a branded one.
- **Stock "diverse team" photos.** Use real photos, candid shots, or one consistent illustration style.

## Code quality

- **Div soup.** Use `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<section>`.
- **Inline styles mixed with classes.** Move everything into the project's styling system.
- **Hardcoded pixel widths.** Use `%`, `rem`, `em`, and `max-width`.
- **Missing alt text.** Describe the content. Never leave `alt="image"` on a meaningful image.
- **Arbitrary z index like `9999`.** Establish a scale in the theme.
- **Commented out dead code.** Remove all debug artifacts.
- **Import hallucinations.** Verify every import exists in the project dependencies.
- **Missing meta tags.** Add `<title>`, description, `og:image`, and social sharing tags.

## Strategic omissions

What AI builds typically forget entirely:

- **No legal links.** Privacy policy and terms in the footer.
- **No back navigation.** Every page needs a way out.
- **No custom 404.** Design a branded, helpful one.
- **No form validation.** Client side checks for email format and required fields.
- **No skip to content link.** Essential for keyboard users.
- **No cookie consent.** Add a compliant banner where the jurisdiction requires it.
- **Landing page indexing not considered.** Ad only and time bound offers should be `noindex`. Evergreen pages need a real title, meta description, internal links, and a plain question and answer FAQ for AEO.

# Upgrade techniques

High impact replacements to pull from once the audit fixes are in.

**Typography**
- Variable font animation, interpolating weight or width on scroll or hover
- Outlined to filled text transitions on scroll entry
- Text mask reveals, with large type acting as a window onto video or imagery

**Layout**
- Broken grid and deliberate asymmetry, with elements overlapping or bleeding off screen
- Whitespace maximization to force focus onto one element
- Parallax card stacks that stick and pile during scroll
- Split screen scroll with halves moving in opposite directions

**Motion**
- Smooth scroll with inertia, decoupled from browser defaults
- Staggered entry, never mounting everything at once
- Spring physics on all interactive elements
- Scroll driven reveals through expanding masks, wipes, or draw on SVG paths

**Surfaces**
- True glassmorphism: `backdrop-filter` plus a 1px inner border and a subtle inner shadow to simulate edge refraction
- Spotlight borders that illuminate under the cursor
- Fixed, `pointer-events: none` grain overlays to break digital flatness
- Colored, tinted shadows carrying the background hue

Note: none of these may reintroduce a background gradient. Depth comes from noise, imagery, shadow, and layering.

# Fix priority

Maximum visual impact, minimum risk, in this order:

1. **Font swap** — biggest instant improvement, lowest risk
2. **Color and surface cleanup** — snap to the approved palette, remove background gradients
3. **Hover, active, and focus states** — makes the interface feel alive
4. **Layout and spacing** — grid, max width, spacing scale, nested radius formula
5. **Motion pass** — custom easing curves, scroll reveals via IntersectionObserver, island nav
6. **Replace generic components** — swap cliche patterns for the alternatives above
7. **Loading, empty, and error states** — makes it feel finished
8. **Copy pass** — remove cliches, add specificity, fix CTAs
9. **Type scale polish** — the premium final touch

# Rules

- Work with the existing tech stack. Do not migrate frameworks or styling libraries.
- Do not break existing functionality. Test after every change.
- Report the diagnosis before applying fixes. Let the user veto items.
- Check the project's dependency file before importing any new library.
- If the project uses Tailwind, check the version, v3 or v4, before touching config.
- If there is no framework, use vanilla CSS.
- Keep changes reviewable and focused. Small targeted improvements over big rewrites.
- Never invent a design value. If it is not in Design Values, ask.

# Design values

The single source of truth for this skill. Edit this section to adapt it to your own design system.

**Fonts:** Geist, Manrope, Geist Mono, Poppins. Never Inter, Roboto, Arial, Open Sans, Helvetica. No italics. No weights above bold.

**Dark backgrounds:** `#000000` · `#181818` · `#1F1F1F` · `#272727` · `#313131` · `#131209`

**Light backgrounds (POS extension):** `#FFFFFF` · `#F7F7F7` · `#EFEFEF` · `#E5E5E5` · `#D4D4D4`. Light text: `#0A0A0A` · `#3D3D3D` · `#6B6B6B`. Light borders: `#E5E5E5` · `#D4D4D4`.

**Accent (single):** `#2F6B4F` · hover `#245A41` · soft `#E8F2EC`. Saturation kept under 80%.

**Hero heading gradient:** dark theme `#FFFFFF` → `#9B9B9B`; light theme `#000000` → `#666666`. Left to right, text only.

**Spacing:** 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80, 96px. Main buttons 8px vertical, 12px horizontal.

**Radius:** Tailwind values only. Nested shapes under a 32px gap use `inner = outer − gap`, applied only when the result exceeds 2.

**Icons:** Phosphor, Solar, Iconamoon.

**Motion:** `transition-all duration-700 ease-[cubic-bezier(0.32,0.72,0,1)]`. Scroll reveals 800ms or longer via `IntersectionObserver`.

**Type scale:** Tailwind default.

| Class | Size | Line height |
|---|---|---|
| `text-xs` | 12px | 16px |
| `text-sm` | 14px | 20px |
